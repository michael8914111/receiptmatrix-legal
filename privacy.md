# Privacy Policy – ReceiptMatrix

**Last updated:** February 2026

## Overview

ReceiptMatrix is a macOS application that helps users organize receipts and generate reports for personal or business use. Privacy is a core principle of ReceiptMatrix. The app is designed to operate locally on your Mac without collecting or transmitting personal data.

## Data Collection

ReceiptMatrix does **not** collect, track, sell, or share personal data.

Specifically:
- No user accounts
- No analytics or telemetry
- No advertising identifiers
- No third-party tracking services

---

## Local Processing

All receipt processing occurs locally on your device, including:
- Optical character recognition (OCR)
- Data extraction (such as dates and totals)
- Organization and categorization
- File renaming
- Report generation

Receipt data does not leave your Mac.

---

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally within the app’s sandboxed storage on your Mac. This may include:
- Receipt files you import
- Extracted receipt information
- App preferences and settings

You control your data at all times. Deleting the app removes its stored data.

---

## Folder Access & Permissions

ReceiptMatrix can access only the folders you explicitly choose.

When you select a folder:
- macOS prompts you to grant permission
- Access is limited to that specific location
- You may revoke access at any time within the app or macOS settings

ReceiptMatrix cannot access files or locations you have not approved.

---

## Background Activity

ReceiptMatrix may perform background tasks while the app is running in order to process receipts or generate exports. Background activity does not involve transmitting data externally.

---

## Exports

Reports and exports are generated locally and saved only to locations you choose. ReceiptMatrix does not upload or share exported data.

---

## Purchases

ReceiptMatrix uses Apple’s App Store in-app purchase system for subscriptions and trials. All payment handling is performed by Apple. ReceiptMatrix does not receive or store payment information.

---

## Network Usage

ReceiptMatrix does not transmit receipt data or personal information over the network.

Internet access may be used only for:
- App Store purchase validation
- App updates through the Mac App Store

---

## Data Deletion

You may delete receipts at any time within the app. Removing the application from your Mac deletes all locally stored app data.

---
