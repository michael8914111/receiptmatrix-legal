# Privacy Policy – ReceiptMatrix

**Last updated:** February 2026

## Overview

ReceiptMatrix is a macOS application for organizing receipts and generating tax-ready reports. Your privacy is a core design principle. ReceiptMatrix is built to operate **entirely on your Mac**, without collecting or transmitting your personal data.

---

## Data Collection

ReceiptMatrix does **not** collect, transmit, sell, or share personal data.

Specifically:
- No user accounts
- No analytics or tracking
- No advertising identifiers
- No third-party data collection services

---

## Local Processing

All receipt processing happens locally on your device, including:
- Optical character recognition (OCR)
- Data extraction (vendor, date, totals)
- Categorization
- File renaming
- CSV and PDF report generation

ReceiptMatrix uses Apple’s on-device frameworks (such as Apple Vision). Receipt data never leaves your Mac.

---

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally within the app’s sandbox on your Mac, including:
- Imported receipt files
- Extracted receipt metadata
- App settings and preferences

You retain full control of your data at all times. Deleting the app removes all stored data.

---

## Folder Access & Permissions

ReceiptMatrix can only access folders that you explicitly select.

When you add a watched folder or export location:
- macOS prompts you to grant permission
- ReceiptMatrix stores a security-scoped bookmark for that folder only
- Access can be revoked at any time by removing the folder in Settings

ReceiptMatrix cannot access files or locations you have not approved.

---

## Background Processing

ReceiptMatrix may perform background processing when the app is **running and minimized**, such as:
- Monitoring user-selected folders
- Processing newly added receipts
- Generating scheduled exports

No data is transmitted externally during background processing.

---

## Exports

Exports (CSV or PDF) are generated locally and saved only to folders you choose. ReceiptMatrix does not upload or share exported data.

---

## Purchases

ReceiptMatrix uses Apple’s App Store in-app purchase system to manage subscriptions and free trials. All payment processing is handled by Apple. ReceiptMatrix does not receive or store payment information.

---

## Network Access

ReceiptMatrix does not send receipt data or personal information over the network.

Internet access may be used only for:
- App Store subscription validation
- App Store updates

No receipt content or user data is transmitted during these operations.

---

## Data Deletion

You can delete receipts at any time within the app. You may also remove all stored data by deleting the application from your Mac.

---

## Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated as the app evolves. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised date.
